Setup and show solutions for the hex puzzle

This is a software version of a physical puzzle [Smartgames IQ mini hexpert](https://www.smartgames.eu/iqmini/hexpert/) where you have to put 6 different shapes into a hexagonal grid. There are also 3 "stops" that move along a track that is used to set up different puzzles.

This just shows the solutions I've found in a pleasing way and makes it easy to setup a puzzle I haven't done yet.
